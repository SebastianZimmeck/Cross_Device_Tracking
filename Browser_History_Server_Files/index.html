	<p><strong><font color="red">Update 04/26/2016, 09:47 PM: At this point you can still sign up. We will try to accomodate you. However, we cannot guarantee anymore that you will receive the (full) payment.</font></strong></p>
	<p><strong><font color="red">Update 04/25/2016, 11:07 AM: We will be closing the registration soon. Thus, please sign up now if you want to participate.</font></strong></p>
	<p><strong><font color="red">Please note: You need an Android device to participate. We do not support iOS.</font></strong></p>
    <p>We want to match devices on the Internet based on browsing and app usage metadata. For example, we want to identify which devices belong to Alice. We also want to see what we can learn about Alice, e.g., that she is a woman.</p>
